# code glossary
setTimeout the function can take another function as an argument - second parameter is time in milliseconds, parameters after that are the other parameters for the function

mousePressed - when mouse is clicked (need to put function in front of it)

recursion is when the function calls itself - creates a loop

set interval - does the function every set interval

putting the function into a variable means you can change the state of the function

counter ++ is add one each time

to restart intervals you can add another function

to restart counter add to if statement 

# workshop task 2 notes
i want to add image as background, learnt createImage function as well as how to load it into the setup as a background so everything is drawn on top. 
im nốt sure why it created the image twice but it looked cool so i left it the way it was.
Used setInterval to create random colored/placed circles on the canvas, it creates circles up until 11 circles and then you need to click to create another 11.
wanted to also add text with setTimeout and mousePressed but i couldn’t figure out how to get both the circles and the text to be triggered by  mousePressed at the same time, so i used doubleClicked for the ‘wow!’ text.
because of the double click, the more you double click for a new wow, the exponentially more circles are generated.
it took me ages to get everything to work properly but i learnt how to use quite a few new p5.js documentations!
